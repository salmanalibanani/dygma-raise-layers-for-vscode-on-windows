# Dygma Raise Layers for Visual Studio Code

If you own a Dygma Raise and use Visual Studio Code on a daily basis, let's collaborate.

Some ground rules:

* This is just a start.  Not much is in there at the moment.

* Keep the number of layers to a minimum.  **Three layers max**.  Two would be even better.

* Should work well with default out-of-the-box experience of VSCode.  No VIM extension!

* When you push changes to a layer, please update the corresponding screenshot as well. 

* I would appreciate if in your PR you could explain the rationale.  It'll be good to understand the reasoning why a certain idea could work better.
